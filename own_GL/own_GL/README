This is a series of exercises done while going through the short course of
computer graphics: https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki
The codes are created in C++ only and in Linux environment. They might compile
and run in other OSs, but I do not promise that :)

The 3D model used only for learning/educational/training purposes and is the
same as in the course (sometimes referred as original source).

The approach implemented in the codes differs from the original source, however,
does not pretend to be a replacement or improvement, but rather used for
learning purposes and demonstration of another way of doing things.

Few differences are:
    1. Instead of TGA images I am using PPM images. The reasons:
       - Make a simple image class (PPM was easier to implement)
       - Create own C++ classes and set of routines to learn not only computer
         graphic but C++ as well
       Only RGB version is used which seems to be enough (RGBA, GRAY and BW can
       be implemented later), after all, the main goal is not to learn how to
       read/write images in C++;
    2. The Geometry class is NOT the same as in the original source and shows
       the hierarchy of geometrical primitives (shapes) which can be put (drawn)
       onto a PPM image;
    3. Implementation of original geometry and model classes is done in a single
       class called Model. The exercises show various ways of implementing this
       class.

The exercises are divided into chapters loosely following the original source
articles structure and implementations of classes vary.
